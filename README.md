THIS IS A REDO OF THE ADMIN-DASHBOARD PROJECT (NEVER FINISHED THE FIRST ONE CAUSE I GOT FRUSTRATED)

1. Set up the HTML: 
    * Sidebar
        - Logo
        - 2 Groups of page links
    * Header
        - Search bar (top left)
        - User profile link (top right) w/ notification bell
        - User greetings (lower left)
        - User methods (lower right)
    * Main-content
        - Your projects
            + Fits two rows/three columns
                - Title
                - Description
                - Options
        - Announcements
            + Fits three rows/one column
                - Title
                - Description
        - Trending
            + Fits four rows/ one column
                - Profile picture (left)
                - Username (right)
                - Description (right)

2. Make the parent grid container for the general layout of the webpage. 

3. Make grid containers inside each section (sidebar, header, main-content). In the sidebar, header, and main-content, use more grids to lay out the appropriate information.
